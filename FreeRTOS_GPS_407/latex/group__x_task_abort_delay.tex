INCLUDE\+\_\+x\+Task\+Abort\+Delay must be defined as 1 in \doxylink{_free_r_t_o_s_config_8h_source}{Free\+RTOSConfig.\+h} for this function to be available.

A task will enter the Blocked state when it is waiting for an event. The event it is waiting for can be a temporal event (waiting for a time), such as when v\+Task\+Delay() is called, or an event on an object, such as when x\+Queue\+Receive() or ul\+Task\+Notify\+Take() is called. If the handle of a task that is in the Blocked state is used in a call to x\+Task\+Abort\+Delay() then the task will leave the Blocked state, and return from whichever function call placed the task into the Blocked state.

There is no \textquotesingle{}From\+ISR\textquotesingle{} version of this function as an interrupt would need to know which object a task was blocked on in order to know which actions to take. For example, if the task was blocked on a queue the interrupt handler would then need to know if the queue was locked.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\+Task} & The handle of the task to remove from the Blocked state.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
If the task referenced by x\+Task was not in the Blocked state then pd\+FAIL is returned. Otherwise pd\+PASS is returned. 
\end{DoxyReturn}
