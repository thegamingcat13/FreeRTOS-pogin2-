                      ##### How to use this driver #####
==============================================================================
[..]
The DMA Extension HAL driver can be used as follows:
 (#) Start a multi buffer transfer using the HAL_DMA_MultiBufferStart() function
     for polling mode or HAL_DMA_MultiBufferStart_IT() for interrupt mode.
                 
   -@-  In Memory-to-Memory transfer mode, Multi (Double) Buffer mode is not allowed.
   -@-  When Multi (Double) Buffer mode is enabled the, transfer is circular by default.
   -@-  In Multi (Double) buffer mode, it is possible to update the base address for 
        the AHB memory port on the fly (DMA_SxM0AR or DMA_SxM1AR) when the stream is enabled.
