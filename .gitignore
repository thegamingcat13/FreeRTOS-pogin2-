# STM32CubeIDE Project .gitignore (for project in subfolder FreeRTOS_GPS_407)

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Eclipse and STM32CubeIDE Metadata/Settings (GLOBAL - ignore wherever they appear)
# These files define workspace and project-specific settings. They are often
# user-specific or temporary and should not be shared across collaborators.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.settings/
.metadata/
.log
# Note: .project, .cproject, .mxproject are critical for the IDE to recognize
# the project, so they are explicitly UN-IGNORED below for the project folder.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Build Artifacts (Generated Files - GLOBAL - ignore wherever they appear)
# These are files generated during the build process (compilation, linking).
# They can be regenerated by any user building the project.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 3. STM32CubeMX Generated Code & Templates (Specific to project folder)
# These are files that STM32CubeMX *generates* or *copies*.
# The `.ioc` file itself (see next section) is the source, not these outputs.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ignore boilerplate template files that are copied from CMSIS packs within your project
FreeRTOS_GPS_407/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32*/Source/Templates/*.s
FreeRTOS_GPS_407/Startup/*.s

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Critical Files (DO NOT IGNORE!)
# These files *must* be included in Git as they are the source configuration
# for your project and STM32CubeMX. They define the project structure and build.
# These rules need the exact path to your project subfolder.
